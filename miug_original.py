                #           -going along with this idea is another window that displays which of the events are currently active,

                #           -this may not be necessary, just lean up and consolidate everything tracking related here,
                #                   there isnt much
                #       -if we show all the masks we are using, maybe we can get better tracking that way
                #           -we had this somehow before but I do not know where, it was showing several different opencv screens all at
                #               various levels of filtered or masked or whatever, if we can get that again then maybe it will help
                #       -figure out what the stuff in this line we use above means:
                #               cnts = cv2.findContours(mask.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL,
                #                                   cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)[-2]
                #       -learn about cv masks, maybe they could be used differently above
                #
                        
                #FOR SQUARE_EVENT:
                #make a required amount of time in order to trigger a square,
                #       this will be more useful once we get better tracking set up, even with the stuttery
                #       tracking we could do something like 90% of the frames in the last 5 seconds must have had
                #       something in that square
                #           also, once we get better tracking maybe we will want to do something like
                #           requiring a certain amount of time completely out of the square
                #it would be cool if the square got more and more filled or something to show that it is being selected, maybe the
                #   square walls could get thicker and thicker like in processing miug's mission control
                
                #   SLIGHTLY RELATED:
                #           -I could make some cool time delayed tracers and such to make designs that are created by the balls
                #           -maybe go fix that formic timer over in android studio
                #           -there may be some cool games that could be made, both by using things you must avoid or get
                #               on the screen, or also just audio stuff, you hear a sound and you must remake that sound
                #               by juggling in the right place
                #                   -I think Joe Marshall had a game like that





                #   NOTES:
                #       -there is the issue of activating/deactivating events. This can be done based on time since the begining of the session,
                #           it could be nice if it could be based on the timestamp of a song in vurtualDJ, that would require getting info
                #           from virtual dj(Maybe not, if everything done to the song was kept track of in the python code then the
                #           timestamp of the song could be known at all times.
                #       -the ANN events replace the current events, there is still second layer stuff to find a good way to deal with.
                #           For instance, an event could temporarily make another event active. A swirl could then make the height hook
                #           up to the volume for the next 10 seconds. What should the user interface be to create these combinations?
                #           Hey! Is it possible that there is no need for this, could the ANN just be fed a bunch of different swirl/height
                #           for the next 10 seconds. The issue I see with this is the part of setting the volume for those 10 seconds that the
                #           user would be hearing the change if the setup was such that another event type was activated(vertical location-volume).
                #           If the ANN is just looking for the height 10 seconds after a swirl, then it wont be giving that volume change
                #           to get it where you want it.
                #       -like the comment above, another way to activate/deactivate events could be through some sort of mission control,
                #           a mode you go into that then has different events that can easily be selected, like you do a swirl then whichever
                #           part of the screen you hang out in for more than a couple seconds activates a certain event or 'level'(see next comment)
                #       -Levels could be entire sets of events that all come together, for instance you could have a pre song level that just uses
                #           peaks to call samples, and you could have another level for mid-song that does tempo change and loops and such, and then
                #           a final level with more samples and whatever for ending the song
                 # many layered vertical loops could be cool that I could activate by juggling higher or lower. Somehow these loops
                 #  could be recorded live or they could be premade               

                #ON THE SUBJECT OF AN ANN CONTROLLING SLIDERS:
                 #      -if it is trained that a gather on the right immediately followed by moving the gather to the far left of the screen
                 #          is volume 100%, and a gather on the right that doesnt move at all is volume 0%, and it is also taught some of the
                 #          places in between as certain %s, it seems like it should be able to figure out the other % roughly by combining
                 #          its liklihoods that it is at those various places.
